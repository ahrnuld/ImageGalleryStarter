# Image Gallery starter project
This repository provides a starting point for the Image Gallery challenge assignment. Can you add the missing functionality?

It contains:
* NGINX webserver
* PHP FastCGI Process Manager with PDO MySQL support

## Installation

1. Install Docker Desktop on Windows or Mac, or Docker Engine on Linux.
